    <p class="about-mallorca">
      Mallorca is a small island in the Balearic Islands of Spain. It is
      extremely historical with a lot of amazing architecture and crystal-clear
      beaches. The island has two spoken languages, Spanish and Catalan. Most
      locals are able to speak both, and children also have classes in school.

    <p class="about-mallorca">
      The main city in Mallorca is called Palma. About 400,000 people live in
      this city. It is home to a lot of history and shopping. It also has its
      own beach!

    <p class="about-mallorca">
      Alcúdia is on the opposite side of the island of Mallorca from Palma. It
      is less populated and is a popular vacation spot. It has a lot of nature
      for hiking and is a popular spot for boats to dock. Alcúdia also has a
      cathedral that dates back to 1302!

    <p class="about-mallorca">
      Mallorca has a lot of great food but my favorites are sobrassada, which is a spreadable cold cut, ensaimada, which is a pastry with lard, and paella con pollo.
